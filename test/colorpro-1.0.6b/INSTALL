SOFTWARE REQUIRED:

# Python with PyRAF, Numpy, and PyFITS
 (ColorPro now works with numpy v1.0b3 and PyFITS v1.1b2)
    http://www.python.org/
    http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf/
    http://numpy.scipy.org/
    http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits

  If you need to install any/all of these on a Mac, 
   I can recommend Universal Python:
     http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html
   and/or the Scipy Superpack:
     http://www.scipy.org/Download

# SExtractor
    http://terapix.iap.fr/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=91/

# (SExSeg packaged with ColorPro)
    http://adcam.pha.jhu.edu/~coe/SExSeg/

# WCSTools: xy2sky, sky2xy, imsize
    http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/wcstools/

- BPZ (OPTIONAL, BUT PACKAGED WITH ColorPro)
    http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/~txitxo/
    (HOWEVER, THE LATEST VERSION IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE WITH ColorPro)

- match (OPTIONAL)
     to automatically correct simple WCS misalignments, namely x / y shifts (STILL IN BETA)

---------------------------------

FINISH INSTALLATION:

By now, you've done the following

gunzip colorpro-1.0.6.tar.gz
tar -xvf colorpro-1.0.6.tar
gunzip bpz-1.99.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf bpz-1.99.1.tar

(Note you may not want to delete the .tar file just yet...)

So you should have ColorPro installed to a colorpro-1.0.6/ directory
and BPZ installed to a bpz-1.99.1/ directory.
Add these directories to your PYTHONPATH, and alias new commands "colorpro" and "bpz", like this:

setenv HOME /home/coe  (use your pathname instead!)
setenv COLORPRO {$HOME}/colorpro-1.0.6
setenv BPZPATH  {$HOME}/bpz-1.99.1
setenv PYTHONPATH {$PYTHONPATH}:{$COLORPRO}:{$BPZPATH}
alias colorpro "python $COLORPRO/colorpro.py"
setenv SEXSEG $COLORPRO
alias sexseg "python $SEXSEG/sexseg.py"
alias bpz "python $BPZPATH/bpz.py"
setenv NUMERIX numpy

Note: Pyraf expects to find "login.cl" in either the current directory or in ~/iraf/
(where ~/ is your home directory).
If your login.cl is somewhere else, either copy it to ~/iraf/
or create ~/iraf as a link to the directory where your login.cl is.

And don't be fooled by my NUMERIX environment variable.
You can't set it to numeric and expect ColorPro to run using Numeric instead of Numpy.
The only thing NUMERIX is good for is that it tells PyFITS to use Numpy instead of Numeric.

---------------------------------

TRY IT OUT!

If you downloaded the example along with ColorPro, navigate to the colorpro-1.0.6/example/ subdirectory.

To run ColorPro, simply type:

colorpro

Or to try out ColorPro on an example that runs straight SExtractor instead of SExSeg:

colorpro straightsex.in

(Note that ColorPro will produce a bunch of intermediate files in addition to the final output catalog.  If you want to keep your example/ subdirectory pristine, it's best to copy the files over to another directory.  If you've already sullied the directory, you can recreate it if you still have the colorpro-1.0.6.tar file!)

ColorPro will automatically look for colorpro.in, the configuration file, which tells it where to find all of your images, etc.

ColorPro will run on a small portion of the UDF (identical to that shown in Fig. 2 in our UDF catalog paper).  Images (including RMS & weight images) are provided in 6 filters: b, v, i, z, j, h.  ColorPro then goes about the messy business of creating detection images, aligning the images, degrading the detection image to the poorer PSFs of the j & h NIC3 images, compiling a segmentation map from 5 sources (again as in Fig. 2), running SExSeg on all the images, and finally collating the final catalog.

The end product is (by default): colorpro.cat
(A more detailed catalog is also produced: phot.cat)

To learn about the contents of colorpro.cat, see MANUAL-OUTPUT.

BPZ is now packaged with ColorPro!
After colorpro.cat is produced, ColorPro will automatically run BPZ for you if you wish.
The resulting catalog is (by default) colorpro_bpz.cat
And finally, a ColorPro+BPZ catalog is produced: colorpro_photbpz.cat
