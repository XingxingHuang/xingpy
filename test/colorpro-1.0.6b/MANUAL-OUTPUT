ColorPro Output
The end product is: colorpro.cat, colorpro_bpz.cat
(unless you provide a different name).
(A more detailed catalog is also produced: sexseg.cat)


colorpro.cat
------------

Object ID numbers correspond to the segmentation map segm.fits. 
For each object, the x, y position is given, followed by the segment area (in pixels), and the PSF-corrected, aperture-matched photometry in all filters.

Output columns b & db give the magnitude and magnitude uncertainty respectively for image b. 
Non-detections are given as b=99, db={magnitude limit, 1-sigma within object's aperture}. 
Non-observations (outside the filter's FOV, or containing saturated or other bad pixels) are given as b=-99. 
Note that this is the format expected by the Bayesian Photo-z software BPZ.


phot.cat
--------
More detailed version of the previous catalog
Contains PSF corrections, etc.


colorpro_bpz.cat
----------------

id: Corresponds to segmenation map
zb: BPZ most likely redshift
zbmin..zbmax : 95% confidence interval
tb: BPZ most likely spectal type
odds: P(z) contained within 2*0.06*(1+z)
zml, tml: Maximum Likelihood most likely redshift & spectral type
chisq: Poorness of BPZ fit: observed vs. model fluxes
chisq2: Modified chisq: model fluxes given error bars
MO: Magnitude used for Prior estimation
nfdet: # of filters in which object was detected
nfdet: # of filters in which object was observed
       (within FOV and with no bad/saturated pixels)

colorpro_photbpz.cat
--------------------
Combines photometry and BPZ results into one catalog.
