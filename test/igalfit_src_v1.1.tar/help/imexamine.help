                              July 15, 2011


   iGalFit has several routines which operate much like the IRAF routine, 
ImExamine (http://iraf.noao.edu).  These routines are run by clicking in 
the main window, and pressing one of the many keys:

m   ImStat.pro    Display a subregion and several statistical measurements.
r   RadProf.pro   Measure and model the radial surface brightness profile.
c   ColPlot.pro   Plot the image brightness for a given column.
l   RowPlot.pro   Plot the image brightness for a given row.
e   ContPlot.pro  Display and model a contour plot at a given position.
h   HistPlot.pro  Display a pixel histogram around a given position.

Additional parameters which are not necessarily ImExamine related, but are 
accessed by with the keyboard in a similar fashion:

+   Zoom in at the center of the view.
-   Zoom out at the center of the view.

Please check future versions, as many new features are likely to be added 
as demand or suggestions dictate.
