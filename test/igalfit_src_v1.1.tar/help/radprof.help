			    July 15, 2011

   RadProf.pro is a subroutine of iGalFit and is designed to operate
like the radial profile procedure as part of ImExamine in IRAF
(http://iraf.noao.edu).  The position of the cursor sets an intial guess, 
which is then recentered using cntrd.pro from AstroLib with a default 
FWHM of 3.0 pixels.  If the recentering fails, RadProf will display an 
error message and *NOT* display a radial profile fit.  When the recentering 
is successful, RadProf will display the one-dimensional surface brightness 
profile out 10.0 pixels (by default).  These data are then fit with two 
functions: 

  (1) Gaussian:

	I(r) = I_0 * exp(-0.5*(r/r_0)^2) + S

  (2) Moffat:
 
	I(r) = I_0 * (1+(r/r_0)^2)^(-beta) + S

where r_0 and beta are labeled as ``width'' and ``shape,'' respectively. 
The refined centroids are given as (x,y).

Preferences
   RadProf.pro has two parameters which are set in the Preferences 
submenu in iGalFit:

   (1) Maxrad: The distance out to which the radial profile is measured.
   (2) FWHM:   The recentering parameter in cntrd.pro.
