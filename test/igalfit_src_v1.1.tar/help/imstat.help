   ImStat is a subroutine of iGalFit and is designed to operate like
the imstat procedure as part of ImExamine in IRAF
(http://iraf.noao.edu).  Unlike the IRAF utility, ImStat shows the
small section (stamp) of main image from which the statistics are
computed.  This stamp is linearly ``autoscaled'' (see XXXX help page) between 
-3 and 10 sigma of the mean, and so the pixel brightnesses depending on 
the objects in the stamp.  Many common statistical measures are presnted, and 
are largely organized by image properties and image moments.

Image Properties:
  (1) Total: Total flux within the region
  (2) Min:   Minimum pixel brightness within the region
  (3) Max:   Maximum pixel brightness within the region
  (4) xr:    X-range of pixels from the main image
  (5) yr:    Y-range of pixesl from the main image
  (6) Npix:  Number of pixels used to compute the statistics
   
Image Moments:
  (1) Ave:    Simple average (first moment)
  (2) Med:    Simple median
  (3) ResAve: Outlier-resistant average, computed by resistant_mean.pro from 
              the AstroLib.  The default sigma clip is 3.0.
  (4) Std:    Simple standard deviation (reduced second moment)
  (5) ResStd: Outlier-resistant standard deviation, computed by 
      	      robust_sigma.pro from the AstroLib.
  (6) Skew:   Simple skew (third moment)
      	    	   
		      <image^3>
	    skew = ---------------
                    <image^2>^1.5

  (7) Kurt:   Simple kurtosis (fourth moment)

      	    	       <image^4>
      	    kurt = ----------------- - 3
 	    	      <image^2>^2


Preferences.
   ImStat has several parameters which are controled by the Preferences 
menu in iGalFit.
  (1) Number of sigma in the computation of ResAve
  (2) Size of stamp
  (3) Do we include pixels with 0 flux? Y/N?
