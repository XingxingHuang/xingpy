 1. Python

    Available at <http://www.python.org/>.

 2. Numeric Python

    Available at <http://numpy.sourceforge.net/>. Be careful which version
    you install; newer versions tend to support only the most recent
    Python release.

 3. GNU plotutils package

    Available at <http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/>. After installing,
    you need to make sure biggles can find libplot.so. On most systems adding
    $(prefix)/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH will work, where $(prefix) is the 
    directory plotutils was installed in (usually /usr/local).

Distutils Installation
----------------------

If you're running Python 2.0 or greater, or have Distutils installed, you can
install biggles using the setup.py file. Try:

	$ cd python-biggles-x.y.z/
	$ python setup.py build_ext -I/path/to/libplot/include
	$ python setup.py install

See the distutils documentation for more information.

Makefile Installation
---------------------

If you don't want to install using Distutils, you can use the Makefile
provided. On most systems running:

	$ cd python-biggles-x.y.z/
	$ gmake
	$ gmake install

will work. The PYTHON variable in make.inc should be set to the command
you use to start the python interpreter (defaults to "python"). The directory
the Makefile chooses to install the module is based on information from the
python sys module, which you can override by changing PYSITEPKGS.

If the libplot library is not installed under /usr/local, and you installed
it from source, edit the "LIBPLOT_PREFIX" line in make.inc to point to the
right directory.
