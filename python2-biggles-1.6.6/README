Biggles : Scientific Plotting with/in/for Python
------------------------------------------------

Biggles is a Python module for creating publication-quality 2D scientific
plots. It supports multiple output formats (postscript, x11, png, svg, gif),
understands simple TeX, and sports a high-level, elegant interface. It's
intended for technical users with sophisticated plotting needs. 

The goal is to produce a plotting package that isn't deeply frustrating. 

Simple Example
--------------

Here's a simple biggles script:

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	import biggles

	x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	y = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

	p = biggles.FramedPlot()
	p.add( biggles.Curve(x, y) )
	p.show()

This produces an X window with a framed plot of the curve y(x).
You can find more in the 'examples/' directory included with the
source distribution.
