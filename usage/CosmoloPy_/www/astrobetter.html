<em>Sample blurb about me, feel free to modify or delete:</em> This is
a guest post by <a href='http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~roban/'>Roban
Hultman Kramer</a>, who is currently an astronomy grad student at
Columbia University, but will be starting as a Zwicky Fellow at ETH
Zurich in January.

<p><a href='http://roban.github.com/CosmoloPy/'>CosmoloPy</a> is a
package of basic cosmology routines for Python, designed for use with
<a href='http://scipy.org/'>NumPy and SciPy</a>. Features currently
include: calculation of cosmological distance measures,
perturbation-theory-based calculation of the matter power spectrum and
halo collapse fraction (courtesy of Eisenstein & Hu's transfer
function code), and integration of simple reionization models and the
resulting electron scattering optical depth due to reionization. I
hope it will prove useful to the increasing number of astronomers
turning to Python.</p>

Using CosmoloPy is as simple as setting up a dictionary of
cosmological parameters (some WMAP5 parameters are provided for
convenience in <code>cosmolopy.parameters</code>) and passing it to
the functions you want to use. For instance, we could quickly calculate the comoving distance to redshift 6 like this:
<pre>
>>> import cosmolopy.distance as cd
>>> cosmo = {'omega_M_0' : 0.3,
...          'omega_lambda_0' : 0.7, 
...          'h' : 0.72}
>>> d_co, err = cd.comoving_distance(z=6., **cosmo)
>>> print "Comoving distance to z=6 is %.1f Mpc" % (d_co)
Comoving distance to z=6 is 8017.8 Mpc
</pre>
A few more lines

and you can produce a plot like the one shown above.
